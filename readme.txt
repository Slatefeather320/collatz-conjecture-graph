the function cool() takes in 3 values, x, e, and o. x is the initial value on which the function will be run.
e is the value the program will devide the number by when it is even 
o is the vaalue the program will multiply the number by before adding 1 when it is odd 
for the conjecture to work the values for e and o have to be 2 and 3 however i included the ability to change these to see how graphs for other values look like. 
keep in mind that for a lot of values of e and o, the program will never terminate.
